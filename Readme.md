## My Algorithm



About this repository, which is my exercise **DATA STRUCTURE** and **ALGORITHM**

It uses four languages, includes C++ï¼ŒJava, Rust, Python





### 1:  Algorithm for Java

Cause the notebook using Java,So I will firstly implement the Algorithm with Java. 

The following are algorithms that have been already implemented.

-   Stack and Quque Convert
-   Circular Deque
-   Get Minimal Number in Stack
-   Singly-Linked List Reverse and Doubly-Linked List Reverse
-   Two Singly-Linked Lists Plus
-   Merge Two Singly-Linked List
-   Partition List
-   Bubble Sort ,Selection Sort, Insertion Sort





### 2: Algorithm for C++ //TODO







### 3: Algorithm for Rust //TODO





### 4: Algorithm for Python //TODO
